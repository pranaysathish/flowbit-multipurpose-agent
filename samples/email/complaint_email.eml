Subject: Extremely Disappointed with Product Quality - Order #54321

Hello Support Team,

I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the quality of the product I received from order #54321 placed on May 20, 2025.

The item arrived damaged and does not function as advertised. This is completely unacceptable given the premium price I paid for what was supposed to be a high-quality product.

I have already attempted to resolve this through your chat support, but the representative was unhelpful and dismissive of my concerns. I demand that this issue be escalated to a manager immediately.

If I do not receive a satisfactory resolution within 24 hours, I will be forced to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and leave negative reviews on all platforms.

I expect a full refund or a replacement product shipped with expedited delivery at no additional cost.

This is urgent and requires your immediate attention.

Regards,
Alex Johnson
